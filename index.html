        Hello, my name is Andrea Garcia. I am currently a second year at the University of California, Riverside. As of right now I am undeclared, thinking about Education major. Throughout my high school and college career I have always worked with kids. 
        <br><br>In high school I was in an academy whose goal was to work with students and teachers.
 	During my last two years in high school I volunteered with an elementary school across the street called Dolores Elementary School. There I was able to work with Transitional Kindergarten and Kindergarten grade students. Although, one-year difference, the kids are very different. I would go over and the I would have the kids go over their spelling and reading. 
	<br><br>My second-year volunteering, I worked in an English-Spanish classroom. Here the students were being taught in both English and Spanish. I would help the students with the alphabet in Spanish. We would also play games that helped them read and write in Spanish. 
	<br><br>In high school I had an internship where I worked with high school students. As it was just an internship I did not have much responsibility. In the program the students have 2 residential weeks. It was my job to make sure all the students were up and ready in the morning. Even if I did not have much work to do, I still had to work with students and make sure everything was running smoothly. 
	<br><br>The following year I was asked to come back as a tutor. This time around I did have more of a responsibility. I had a group of 13 students who I had to correct papers, help them on and one with homework or classwork. The las 2 weeks of the program I had to make sure all the students were ready for bed and make sure the students were all in the rooms. 
<br><br>Currently I am working with the Boys and Girls Club. Here I am working with elementary school students. I have a 2nd and 3rd grade mixed class of 20 students that I assist. With the students I help them with their homework, plan activities and lessons, and enrichment time. 
Although working with kids of any age can be hard and stressful, I enjoy it. I enjoy seeing progress in the students and see how I have helped them in any way.
